I’m thinking of a number
Create a bash script that plays the number guessing game.  You know the game where one person thinks of a number between 1 and 100, then the guesser guesses the number.  The first person then tells the user if the correct answer is higher or lower than their guess.  In our case the person thinking of the number will be a bash script.  This is script is to be done by yourself.  You are not allowed to submit a script written whole or in part by anyone else.
Requirements:
•	Create a script name guess.sh
•	Place the following comment after the shebang at the top of your script
•	#I, <your name here>, affirm that I am the sole author of this script, it is my own original work
#Date: <Date goes here>
•	#Version <version number goes here>
•	Replace the appropriate areas with your name, date and version
•	The script will choose a random number from 1 to 100 and ask the user to guess the number.
•	The user enters their guess.
•	The script determines if the answer is higher, lower or correct.
•	If the correct answer is higher or lower than the guess inform the user (higher or lower) and let them guess again.
•	Keep track of the number of guesses.
•	If the answer was correct let the user know how many guesses it took to get the correct answer.
•	Return the number of guesses as the program exit code.
•	HINT:  use the bash function  $RANDOM to get a random number, use whatever resources you can find to figure out how to use $RANDOM.$
•	I have uploaded a bash quick reference guide to help you with the test conditions.
